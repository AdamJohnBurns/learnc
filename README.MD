#LearnC

Re-learning the C language from the book Learn C the Hard Way. All work done via the commandline
as an additional learning exercise.

Things I've learned about nano:
* Start with `-m` to enable the mouse cursor.
* Hotkeys generally use the `control` key on mac. This is represented as a ^ character.
* ^G is help
* ^O is save 
* ^X is close
* ^W is find ('Where is the thing?")
* ^C shows line number details on currently selected line
* There doesn't seem to be a way to enable line number display

Things I've learned about git:
* List all files in the .git index with `git ls-files`
* Remove an item from the index that's already been added: `git rm --cached <filename>`
