#LearnC

Re-learning the C language from the book Learn C the Hard Way. All work done via the commandline
as an additional learning exercise.

Things I've learned about nano:
* Start with `-m` to enable the mouse cursor.
* Hotkeys generally use the `control` key on mac. This is represented as a ^ character.
* ^G is help
* ^O is save 
* ^X is close
* ^W is find ('Where is the thing?")
